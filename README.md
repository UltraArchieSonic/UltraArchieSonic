I am doing Godot programming, and lemonscript! 
At the moment, I am working on a game, which takes inspiration from Sonic.EXE The Disaster
fun thing is... It's not going to be a Sonic.EXE game though. It's going to be a Sonic game!
It's going to be based on the Archie Comics and Fan content, like Nazo unleashed etc.
more info Soon!

I am also working on a few Sonic 3 AIR mods! like Sonic with Goku's forms! or another Sonic mod...
based on the Sonic X mod for Sonic Robo Blast 2, I present... X Sonic in Sonic 3 A.I.R. It's going to be very similar to the X Sonic in SRB2 mod,
so look out for that too!
